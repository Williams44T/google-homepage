From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Trying to duplicate the Google homepage turned out to be more difficult than expected, but at long last I have a product I'm happy with.

Some of the more important skills/knowledge I gained:
- several ways to position elements
- that there are more css properties than I could ever imagine
- how to make very good use out of Chrome's developer tools

I feel I still have a long way to go regarding accessibility and responsiveness, but I'll get there.

This code still feels a bit sloppy to me, but I'd rather move on to other projects than spend time cleaning it up. Maybe I'll get to it another day.
